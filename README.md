This is the source code for Jumpy Box, a Unity2D side-scrolling/endless runner platforming game currently hosted on itch.io. Originally developed over the summer of 2022, I've since then updated it inconsistently. The biggest update so far has been the addition of an online leaderboard (locatedusing Microsoft PlayFab and a site hosted on Glitch, which was completed on April 28th, 2023. 
As of January 2024, itch.io reports that the game has been run 633 times, with 380 usernames registered since the leaderboard was implemented. This is by far my most successful project, which can be entirely credited to athe mild degree of popularity that it reached in my middle and high school between April and June of 2023.
